        "# Encapsulation and Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental pillars of object‑oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the practice of **bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit**, usually a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of encapsulation as a protective wrapper:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A class hides its internal state (fields) from the outside world.\n",
        "- It only exposes what is necessary through controlled access points (properties and methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why is encapsulation important?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Control** – you decide how external code can interact with your object.\n",
        "- **Safety** – prevents accidental changes to internal data.\n",
        "- **Flexibility** – internal implementation can change without affecting other code.\n",
        "- **Clarity** – objects present a clear interface of what they can do.\n",
