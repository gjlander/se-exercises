    "\n",

    "A **class** is the most common reference type in C#. Classes are designed to model complex, long-lived objects that often have behaviour as well as state.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Support inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "- Default equality is reference-based (two variables are equal only if they refer to the same object).\n",
    "- Typically mutable, but you can design immutable classes.\n",
