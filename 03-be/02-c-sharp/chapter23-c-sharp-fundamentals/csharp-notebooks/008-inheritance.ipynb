        "# Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is the mechanism in object‑oriented programming that allows a class to **reuse attributes and methods** from another class. The class that provides functionality is called the **base class**, and the class that derives from it is called the **derived class**.\n",
        "\n",
        "With inheritance, you avoid repeating code and can build hierarchies of related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reuse:** Share fields and methods across multiple classes.\n",
        "- **Extension:** Derived classes add new behaviour without rewriting everything.\n",
        "- **Polymorphism:** A derived class can override base methods to change behaviour.\n",
        "- **Sealing:** You can prevent further inheritance when needed (`sealed` classes or `sealed` overrides).\n",
        "- **Composition vs inheritance:** Prefer composition when a \"has‑a\" relationship fits better (e.g., a ticket *has a* QR code) to avoid overly rigid hierarchies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hiding vs overriding\n",
        "\n",
        "In C#, there are two strategies when a derived class provides its own implementation of a member from the base class:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hiding** with the `new` keyword. The base member still exists, but the derived class introduces a new one with the same name. Calls depend on the variable type. This binding happens at compile time. If we forget the `new` keyword to hide, the compiler will warn us."

        "- `Ticket` is the **base class** with common properties (`Holder`, `Price`) and a virtual method `PrintInfo()`.\n",
        "- `ConcertTicket` and `TrainTicket` are **derived classes** that extend the base class and override `PrintInfo()` to provide more specific details.\n",
        "- The `: base(...)` call in constructors lets derived classes initialise the base class.\n",
        "- The `base.PrintInfo()` call shows how derived classes can reuse base logic and then add their own.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sealed classes and methods\n",
        "\n",
        "- A **sealed class** cannot be inherited from.\n",
        "- A **sealed method** cannot be overridden further in derived classes.\n",

        "### Inheritance vs composition\n",
        "\n",
        "While inheritance is powerful, overusing it can lead to rigid hierarchies. Often it’s better to use **composition**—for example, a `Reservation` class that *contains* a `Ticket` rather than *inherits* from it. Composition tends to be more flexible and avoids deep inheritance chains.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key takeaway\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows you to build on existing classes instead of starting from scratch. It’s a cornerstone of OOP in C#, enabling code reuse, clarity, and flexibility. Use it when a clear “is‑a” relationship exists, and prefer composition when you just need to reuse behaviour."
