    "# Async/Await\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous programming lets your application handle multiple operations at once without blocking execution. In C#, the primary tools for writing asynchronous code are the `async` keyword and the `await` operator. Together, they help you write code that looks synchronous but runs asynchronously, improving responsiveness and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Asynchronous Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Responsiveness**: In desktop or mobile apps, you don't want the UI to freeze while waiting for a long-running operation like a network call.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: In server apps, async I/O allows handling many requests with fewer threads.\n",
    "- **Resource efficiency**: Threads are expensive. Async methods free up threads to handle other work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `Task` and `Task<T>` Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Task` represents an asynchronous operation that doesn't return a value.\n",
    "- `Task<T>` represents an asynchronous operation that returns a result of type `T`.\n",
    "- They can be awaited or composed with methods like `Task.WhenAll`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `async` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "- Marks a method as asynchronous.\n",
    "- Allows use of `await` inside it.\n",
    "- Changes the method's return type to `Task`, `Task<T>`, or `ValueTask`.\n",
    "\n",

    "Key parallels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Promises vs Tasks**: TypeScript async functions return a `Promise<T>`. C# async methods return `Task<T>`. Both represent a value that will be available in the future.\n",
    "- **Error handling**: TypeScript uses `try/catch` around awaited calls, same as C#.\n",
    "- **Composition**: In TypeScript, `Promise.all([ ... ])` waits for multiple promises. In C#, `Task.WhenAll(...)` does the same for tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Await Pauses Execution, Not the Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ It's important to understand that when you use `await`, code after the `await` line does not execute until the awaited task is finished. **But this does not block the thread** control is returned to the caller so that thread can do other work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- `async` and `await` make asynchronous programming approachable.\n",
    "- C# uses `Task`/`Task<T>` where TypeScript uses `Promise<T>`.\n",
    "- Error handling and composition patterns are almost identical across the two languages.\n",
    "- Async code improves responsiveness and scalability.\n",
    "- Use exception handling and composition tools to manage tasks effectively."
